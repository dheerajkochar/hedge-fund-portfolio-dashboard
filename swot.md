Here’s a **short and crisp SWOT** you can use on LinkedIn or in interviews:

---

## SWOT Analysis – Portfolio Analytics System

### Strengths

* Real-world financial logic (FIFO P&L, drawdown, equity curve)
* SQL-first, audit-friendly design
* Time-aware joins & window functions
* Not a generic CRUD project

---

### Weaknesses

* Not optimized for very large datasets yet
* No real-time/live data


---

### Opportunities

* Can become a full quant research platform
* Add strategy backtesting & alerts
* Strong resume differentiator
* Can be deployed as a SaaS-style tool

---

### Threats

* Complexity can grow fast if unmanaged
* Existing platforms already exist (but this is for learning & customization)
* Data quality issues can affect results

---

If you want, I can rewrite this into a **one-paragraph version** for LinkedIn or your README.
